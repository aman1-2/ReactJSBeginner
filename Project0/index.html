    <!-- Going to Create a new React Element. So we are creating a new React Element with the help of
     createElement function which has three arguments in it the first and formost argument is the type of element which we are going to create,
     as the second argument we pass an object which has key-value pairs which tells the type of properties we can to add in our element like the className etc.
     and the third argument is optional which is children of the elements -->
    <script>
        const App = () => {
            // Here we are passing the porps as empty.
            // Now as the third argument we need to pass its child element, the child element which is going to be used for div
            // So here are the child we are just going to create an other react element. And inside the child element we passed its child as a Text.

            return React.createElement(
                'div', 
                {}, 
                React.createElement('h1', {}, "Welcome to React"),
                React.createElement('button', {}, "Click Me")
            ); //It will not automatically render on the DOM.

        }  

        //How can we select an element.
        const rootNode = document.getElementById('root');
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootNode); //The HTML which wants to become as Root element is passed as an argument.

        root.render(App()); //So we have just wrapped our element inside a function and called that function but nothing great has happened our web-page is still blank.
